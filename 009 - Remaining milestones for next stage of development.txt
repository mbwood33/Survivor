Remaining milestones for a basic prototype
A) Player survivability + run flow

HP & damage UI: tiny HP bar + numeric HP.

Death handling: freeze input → results screen stub (time survived, kills).

Run timer: mm:ss on HUD.

Pause menu: pause/resume; show controls; quit-to-title stub.

B) Basic loot → level ups (super simple)

XP/level bar already wired → on level-up:

For now: auto-apply a random small buff (e.g., +5% damage/speed) or cycle between 3 fixed buffs.

Log the upgrade to a tiny “build” panel (text list).

C) Minimal content data

Hardcode one weapon per variant + one enemy archetype.

Put stats in a single TS/JSON object so you can tweak without code changes.

Seeded RNG utility (one global seed): ensures reproducible spawns.

D) Audio & feedback (bare minimum)

SFX stubs: pickup blip, hit tick, level-up chime (even silent/no-op functions for now).

Visual hits: enemy tint-on-hit (already), player hurt flash, tiny screen shake on big hit.

E) HUD polish (primitive but readable)

Top-left: HP bar, Level + XP bar.

Top-right: Timer.

Bottom-left: Kills, Enemies alive.

Bottom-right: FPS (debug), Projectiles / Enemies / Orbs counts.

F) Performance guardrails

One reusable Graphics for all debug overlays (clear() per frame).

SpatialGrid verified for: projectile queries, magnet orbs, and enemy proximity.

Pools: enemies, projectiles, AOEs, orbitals, XP orbs (no destroy() in hot paths).

Frame budget sanity: cap spawns per tick; early-out collision queries.

G) Build & debug quality-of-life

Global debug toggles: F1 colliders, F2 collision sweeps, F3 camera boxes, F4 enemy info, F5–F8 weapon/aoe/orbit debug.

Hot reload-ish path: keep constants in one module; recompile = quick test.

Cheats: B burst enemies, P fire volley, K kill-all, L force level-up.

H) Title → game → results loop (stubs)

Title screen: “Start Run” → loads GameScene with seed.

Results screen: time survived, level reached, kills; “Restart” (new seed) / “Title”.

Save nothing yet (meta/progression later).

Suggested “finish line” order (2–4 focused sessions)

Run flow: timer, HP/damage UI, death → results stub.

Level-ups: auto-apply a tiny random buff; HUD line for last upgrade.

HUD polish + debug toggles consolidated.

Performance pass: verify 60 FPS with ~300 enemies & lots of projectiles.

Title/results stubs + restart loop.

Acceptance criteria for “basic prototype”

Start at Title, press Start → in-game with seed shown.

Move, shoot, kill; enemies spawn continuously at edges.

Take damage on contact; die → Results screen with time/kills; Restart works.

Level-ups occur and visibly change something (damage/speed/cooldown).

Stable 60 FPS under stress (on your dev machine).

Debug overlays make it obvious what’s happening.
